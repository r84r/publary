  abstract     = {A variety of analytical and numerical approaches for calculating the friction temperature have been developed in the past. However, none is capable to estimate the friction temperature of thermoplastic friction pairings. Therefore, a semi-analytical model for predicting the friction temperature has been developed. Dry friction and periodically recurring contact is a premise. In the article the derivation is shown und influencing parameters are explained. A validation is made by experimental studies on a conveyor system. The model can be applied to sliding chain conveyor as well as perspectively similar tribological systems.},
