  abstract  = {Vibrations appearing in transport chain conveyors cause disadvantageous effects in conveying processes and decrease the durability of chains. In order to investigate these vibrations, a conveyor system with sliding chain made of plastic has been selected. Based on a generalized abstraction of this system, a multi-body simulation model was developed which considers viscoelastic properties of the sliding chain. The model was verified by measurements in the conveyor system. Finally, influencing factors on dynamic behavior were examined in more detail by variant calculations.},
